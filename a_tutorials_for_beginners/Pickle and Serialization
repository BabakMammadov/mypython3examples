Python Modullari for serialization
marshal is a more primitive module for serialization in Python, and its purpose is to support .pyc files.
json is a standard library module for serialization and deserialization with Python.

To serialize and deserialize, we use functions pickle dumps() and loads(),

Data serialization is the concept of converting structured data into a format that allows it to be shared or stored in such a way that its original structure to be recovered. In some cases, the secondary intention of data serialization is to minimize the size of the serialized data which then minimizes disk space or bandwidth requirements

x = 7
import os

import pickle

f = open("abc.txt", 'r+b')

print(pickle.dump(x,f))

print(pickle.dumps(x))

f.seek(0)
pickle.load(f)


grades = { 'Alice': 89, 'Bob': 72, 'Charles': 87 }
#Use dumps to convert the object to a serialized string
serial_grades = pickle.dumps( grades )
#Reverse
noserial_grades = pickle.loads(serial_grades)
print(serial_grades)
print(noserial_grades)
